Project Description
-------------------

- Title: swifswap
- Description:
  - Swifswap is an app that makes trading your goods enjoyable, once again, just like back in the day.  Only now we don't need to carry around our heavy armour and gold.  Swifswap is a platform that will host your swappabilia, and make it much easier to find others interested in what you got.
- Target Audience
  - Users who enjoy trading
